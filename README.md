## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims for early detection and accurate prediction of cardiac diseases, this can significantly improve patient outcomes by allowing timely intervention and treatment. The hypothesis is that specific patterns and characteristics in the shape of the heart, as visualized through medical imaging techniques, may be indicative of underlying cardiac conditions and can be utilized as a predictive tool.
